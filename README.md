# Skyscrapers
Implementation of a Sudoku-like game Skyscrapers using pygame

The game will only run properly if you have a Python interpreter with pygame installed. Here's how to set everything up: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

To start the game, you should open the file skyscrapers/skyscrapers.py

Note: levels with board size bigger than 6x6 may take more than a few seconds to load. Loading a 9x9 board size level may take a bit more than a minute.
